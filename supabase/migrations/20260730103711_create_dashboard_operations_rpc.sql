-- Pipeline, territory and location-confidence counters for the dashboard.
--
-- The original KPIs were written before leads, territories and rep-confirmed
-- store positions existed, so the page reported a system smaller than the one
-- that is running. These are the counters those three subsystems produce.
--
-- Follow-ups are deliberately NOT range-scoped. A follow-up that fell due last
-- month is still owed today, and hiding it because the date picker moved would
-- defeat the point of the field.
